The moving process was so slow that services and even a funeral were conducted while the church was in the middle of the street. The brick edifice, which is now the Little Rock A.M.E. Zion Community Development Center, was completed in 1911 under the administration of Rev. Douglas. The edifice was a blended manifestation of the turn of the century Greek and Romanesque architectural style. J. M.

William White was appointed as pastor, erecting the present building. Dr. James R. Samuel followed Rev. William White making improvements to the Church and Educational Wing. In 2005 Dr. Dwayne A.
