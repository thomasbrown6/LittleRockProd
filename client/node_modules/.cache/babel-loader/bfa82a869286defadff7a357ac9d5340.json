Among the leaders of the movement was James\r\n                      Varick, who was the first Bishop and to whom is attributed\r\n                      the founding father of the Zion Church. Zion church was\r\n                      incorporated in 1801 by the name “The African Methodist\r\n                      Episcopal church in New York.” Methodist Episcopal was\r\n                      always in the title to exhibit the retention of the\r\n                      doctrine and form of church government under which the\r\n                      denomination originated. “African” was prefixed to the\r\n                      rest of the title of this church because it was to be\r\n                      controlled by descendants of Africa, in the interest of\r\n                      humanity, regardless of race, color, sex, or condition.\r\n                      Therefore, these people of African descent, with an\r\n                      indubitable pride in the Fatherland and abiding love of\r\n                      kinship, desired to maintain their identity, their ancient\r\n                      cultures and background for posterity. Because another\r\n                      organization came into existence around the same time,\r\n                      with the same title, and so much confusion was brought\r\n                      about, the General Conference of 1848 voted to make ZION a\r\n                      part of the denominational name, henceforth, to be known\r\n                      as the African Methodist Episcopal Zion church.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      {\" \"}\r\n                      From the very outset the Zion Church has been in the\r\n                      forefront in the battle for full citizenship and freedom\r\n                      in this country. The AME Zion Church encompasses all of\r\n                      the United States, Canada, Caribbean Islands, England,\r\n                      Africa, India and South America, and it is under the\r\n                      supervision of twelve (12) elected Bishops. The New York\r\n                      Conference, of which we are a part, is a part of the North\r\n                      Eastern Episcopal Area. This Episcopal Area includes New\r\n                      York, Western New York, New England and The Bahamas\r\n                      Conferences.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p className=\"bold\">Methodist – It’s Beginning</p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      <span className=\"bold\">WHERE: </span> The Methodist Church\r\n                      started in Oxford, England, in the Holy Room on the campus\r\n                      of Oxford University.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      <span className=\"bold\">WHO: </span>John Wesley, an\r\n                      evangelist and his brother, Charles Wesley, a writer.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      <span className=\"bold\">WHY: </span>Out of protest. The\r\n                      religion of England was Roman Catholicism, a faith which\r\n                      gives the Pope all the authority in to how one should\r\n                      worship God. The Wesley brothers felt that each individual\r\n                      should be free to worship God at will. So, out of protest,\r\n                      the Protestant Church, which is simply a Christian Church\r\n                      or a group of Christians, split from the Roman Catholic\r\n                      Church in the 16th Century because of a desire to study\r\n                      the bible and worship God in their own way, was organized.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      <span className=\"bold\">HOW: </span> These brothers along\r\n                      with a few other students held services daily in the Holy\r\n                      Room.
