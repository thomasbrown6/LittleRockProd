We strongly\r\n                      encourage family worship at least once per week. A good\r\n                      member will seek to attend public worship each Sunday.\r\n                      Whenever possible, he/she will attend mid-week bible\r\n                      study, and other church activities. He/she will lose no\r\n                      opportunity to cultivate his/her spiritual life.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                  </Col>\r\n                  <Col xs={1} />\r\n                </Row>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </Container>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n);\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
